# Pricing-and-Hedging
For this project, we are going to work through American Options.

This project will compare different methods to price American call and put options. Two models are presented for pricing American options: the binomial tree method and trinomial tree. The project scope will include just stock options. Researching about the stocks, we found that most of them pay dividends with some frequency. For the simplicity of pricing our model, we would like to work only with stocks that do not pay dividends but also have liquidity to find data with good quality and accuracy. That way, we got to choose our 4 stocks for the project: Berkshire Hathaway (ticker: BRK.B), Facebook (ticker: FB), United Airlines Holdings (ticker: UAL) and Amazon (ticker: AMZN). In addition, we will also do the price modeling of the S&P 500 Index. So the initial idea is to price these Stock Options for at least 4 different maturities and
consider one Call and one Put for each maturity, for a total of 40 options for each method.
